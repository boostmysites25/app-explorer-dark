    category: "Commercial Applications",
    description: "Let AI talk to your leads — book meetings, qualify prospects, and grow your sales while you sleep. SpeakFlow AI is a revolutionary SaaS that replaces traditional sales calling teams with intelligent AI voice agents. It automatically calls, speaks, and qualifies leads in real time using human-like natural voices that adapt tone, emotion, and language. Businesses can simply upload a lead list or connect their CRM — and SpeakFlow AI takes over from there. Sales teams spend 60–70% of their time doing repetitive, low-conversion calls: calling unqualified leads, following up manually, missing calls in different time zones, and struggling with language barriers. SpeakFlow AI transforms this entire process by letting AI voice agents handle your sales calls. The AI qualifies leads using conversation-based logic, answers FAQs and handles objections, and books appointments directly on your calendar.",
